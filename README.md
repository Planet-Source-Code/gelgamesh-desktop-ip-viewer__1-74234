### Description

So, What's that "DESKTOP IP VIEWER" Thing?!

This desktop application will display your External (Not Local) IP.

Means, your PC ip on the internet.

Anyway, I didn't see (or may be i didn't search enough) about an application that do so.

So, i started to write this simple application.

It's only 1 line.

Yup, Only 1 Line.

No more talking, and it's the time to start working.

Rate if you like it. Comment if you wanna ask or complain about something.
